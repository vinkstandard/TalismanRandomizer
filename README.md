# Talisman Randomizer

👉 [Italiano](README.it.md) 

**TalismanRandomizer** is an unofficial tool designed to support players of *Talisman: The Magical Quest Game*, the famous fantasy board game created by Robert Harris and published by Games Workshop and Fantasy Flight Games.

🎯 **Project Goals**  
This project was born both as an educational tool for learning programming and as a way to:

- Provide a practical digital assistant for Talisman players  
- Automate repetitive setup phases of the game  
- Explore random logic and game content management in a software environment

🔴 TalismanRandomizer is an unofficial fan-made tool for personal and community use.  
🔴 This project is not affiliated with, supported by, or authorized by Games Workshop, Fantasy Flight Games, Asmodee, or any other rights holders of Talisman.  
🔴 All rights to the names, artwork, and original game content belong to their respective owners.

🕹️ **How to Use**  
When you launch the program, an interactive window will appear to guide you step-by-step through the game setup.

🟢 **Procedure:**  
- **Enter the number of players**  
  In the initial window, you will be asked to enter how many players will take part in the game. The number entered will determine how many characters will be drawn.

- **Select expansions**  
  You can then select, via a simple interface, which Talisman expansions to include in the character pool. Only characters from the selected expansions will be considered in the draw.

- **Draw characters**  
  Once your preferences are set, click on the "Draw Characters" button. The program will randomly assign characters to each player.

🟢 In just a few seconds, you'll have a personalized and completely random setup—perfect to start your magical adventure in the world of Talisman!
