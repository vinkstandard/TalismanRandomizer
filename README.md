**TalismanRandomizer** is an unofficial tool designed to support players of Talisman Digital Edition, the famous fantasy board game created by Robert Harris and published by Games Workshop and Fantasy Flight Games.

**Project Goals**  

- I wanted to create an useful tool and in the same time, train my Java skills.
- I wanted to play the game in a different way.

>  In the initial window, you will be asked to enter how many players will take part in the game. The number entered will determine how many characters will be drawn.
>
> - **Select expansions**  
>  You can then select, via a simple interface, which Talisman expansions to include in the character pool. Only characters from the selected expansions will be considered in the draw.

> Two versions of TalismanRandomizer source codes are available, both created and maintained by me:

>
> **Command-Line Version (CMD):** (only available in italian)
> - https://github.com/vinkstandard/github-intelliJ/blob/master/src/ChallengeInteressanti/TalismanRandomizer.java

> [!NOTE]
> **At the moment the program runs smoothly on Windows devices, dunno about other OS**
> 
> In some cases, when running the program windows will alert you saying that it may be dangerous, however, it's not, feel free to scan it with any tools like https://www.virustotal.com/
> The intended use for this tool:
> After you have you generate the characters, you can choose any of your liking(in game) and your friends will do the same.
> It's basically a different option between Picking(selecting characters manually) and Random(only get 1 random character).
